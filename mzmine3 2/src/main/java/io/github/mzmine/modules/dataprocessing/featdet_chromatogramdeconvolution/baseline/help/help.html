<h1>Chromatogram deconvolution</h1>

<h2>Baseline cut-off</h2>

<p>
    This method is very simple and useful to demonstrate the functionality of chromatogram deconvolution. First, the
    algorithm removes the lowest part of the chromatogram below a <em>Baseline level</em> specified by the user.
    Remaining peaks that stand out above the baseline level are recognized if they fulfill the height and duration
    requirements.
</p>

<h4>Method parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Min peak height</dt>
    <dd>Minimum acceptable peak height (absolute intensity)</dd>

    <dt>Peak duration range</dt>
    <dd>Range of acceptable peak durations</dd>

    <dt>Baseline level</dt>
    <dd>Level below which all data points of the chromatogram are removed (absolute intensity)</dd>
</dl>
