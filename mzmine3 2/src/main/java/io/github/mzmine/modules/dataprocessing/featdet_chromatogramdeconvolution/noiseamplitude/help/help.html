<h1>Chromatogram deconvolution</h1>

<h2>Noise amplitude</h2>

<p>
    This method is suitable for chromatograms with significant background noise of varying intensities. It works in a
    similar way to the Baseline cut-off method, but sets the baseline level individually for each chromatogram,
    depending on the amplitude of signal noise.
</p>

<p>
    The baseline level is calculated as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The intensity range of the chromatogram is divided into bins of the user-specified size (the <em>Noise
        amplitude</em> parameter)
    </li>
    <li>The bin with the highest number of data points is found. This bin represents the intensity level of the noise
        signal.
    </li>
    <li>The baseline level is set to the intensity of the bin with the most data points</li>
</ol>
