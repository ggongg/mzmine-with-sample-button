<h1>Chromatogram deconvolution</h1>

<h2>Savitzky-Golay</h2>

<p>
    This method uses the Savitzky-Golay polynomial (A. Savitzky and M. J. E. Golay, <em>Anal. Chem.</em>,
    <strong>36</strong>, 1627 (1964)) to calculate the smoothed second-derivative of the chromatogram's intensities. The
    following figure (left) presents the shape of (a) a Gaussian peak, (b) the first derivative, and (c) the second
    derivative. The figure on the right side shows how the signal (blue line) may be divided into individual
    chromatographic peaks by observing the second derivative.
