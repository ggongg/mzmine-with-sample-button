<h1>MS2 to feature grouping</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Call this method on any (aligned) feature list to assign all 
fragmention scans to their corresponding features.
</p>


<h3>Important note:</h3>
<p>
This module was also introduced because of a data structure 
change in MZmine.38. All projects that were created with 
older version should run this module on their feature lists 
to assign all MS2 scans to their features.
</p>


<h4>Method parameters</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Limit by RT edges</dt>
<dd>Use the feature's retention time edges to filter MS2 scans. Only scans within the feature's RT range are considered</dd>
</dl>
