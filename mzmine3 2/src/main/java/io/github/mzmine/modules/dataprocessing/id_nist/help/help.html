        <h1>Identification - NIST MS Search</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This module allows searching spectra against spectral libraries 
            using the <a href="http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/">NIST MS Search</a> program.
        </p>

        <p>
            NIST MS Search accepts spectra as input to its searches. The <i>MS level</i> may be specified to limit a 
            search to MS/MS fragment spectra, clustered spectra produced from any <i>Spectral Deconvolution</i>
            module, or MS1 precursors ions. The spectra will be searched using the default library search parameters
            in the <i>NIST MS Search</i> program. To adjust these parameters: open the program, adjust the library
            search parameters, and save the configuration to a *.INI file. Note - Automation must be enabled in
            the library search options to enable automatic searching. Be sure all appropriate libraries are included
            before starting a search.
        </p>

        <p>
            Repeated MS/MS spectra may be merged between multiple data files using the
            <i>Merge MS/MS (experimental)</i> module. The input <i>Mass list</i> filters the
            fragment ions by intensity, and repeatable signals are assessed via cosine
            dot product.
        </p>

        <p>
            The module can also be run for an individual row of the peak-list table by highlighting the row and then selecting
            <i>NIST MS Search</i> from the pop-up menu (right mouse-button click). In such
            cases, the <i>NIST MS Search</i> is formed in the same way as described above.
        </p>

        <h4>Method Parameters</h4>

        <dl>
            <dt>NIST MS Search directory</dt>
            <dd>Full path of the directory containing the <i>NIST MS Search</i> executable (nistms$.exe).</dd>

            <dt>MS level</dt>
            <dd>MS spectra level for searching. Use MS level = 1 to search clustered
                spectra produced from <i>Spectral Deconvolution</i> modules. 
            </dd>

            <dt>Mass list</dt>
            <dd>MS/MS fragment ion mass list. Use this to specify noise level in acquired
                MS/MS spectra. <b>Mass list is only used during MS/MS merging - use a dummy
                    list for all other searches.</b>
            </dd>

            <dt>Min. match factor</dt>
            <dd><i>NIST MS Search</i> calculates a match factor (0 .. 999) between the submitted spectrum and each hit. Ignore hits
                with a match factor below the given threshold.
            </dd>

            <dt>Min. reverse match factor</dt>
            <dd><i>NIST MS Search</i> calculates a <i>reverse</i> match factor (0 .. 999) between the
                submitted spectrum and each hit. Ignore hits with a reverse match factor below the given threshold.
            </dd>

            <dt>Merge MS/MS (experimental)</dt>
            <dd>Optional parameter. Merge multiple MS/MS spectra into consensus feature
                using specified parameters.
            </dd>

            <dt>Integer m/z</dt>
            <dd>Optional parameter. Convert accurate mass <i>m/z</i> measurements to low-resolution
                integer values.
            </dd>

        </dl>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>
            This module relies on the NIST MS Search software, which is currently only available for Microsoft Windows, being
            installed.
