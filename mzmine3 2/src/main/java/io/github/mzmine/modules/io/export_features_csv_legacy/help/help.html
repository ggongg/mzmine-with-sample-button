<h1>CSV export</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This module exports the contents of the peak list into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format file, which can later be processed by MS Excel or other tools. 
CSV file export is a one-way operation, CSV files cannot be imported back to MZmine. 
Missing values such as heights and areas of undetected peaks are exported as 0.
