<h1>MSP Export</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    This module exports fragmentation spectra of peaks in the peak list into MSP format file.
    In addition to the spectra, the following peak characteristics are saved into the file:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Name of the peak as displayed in the peak list</dd>

    <dt>DB#</dt>
    <dd>Row number in the peak list</dd>

    <dt>RT (optional)</dt>
    <dd>Retention time of a feature</dd>

    <dt>ANOVA_P_VALUE (optional)</dt>
    <dd>P-value calculated by the module Data analysis -> One-way ANOVA Test</dd>

    <dt>Num Peaks</dt>
    <dd>Number of peaks in the spectrum</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Method Parameters</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>Add retention time</dt>
    <dd>If selected, each MSP record will contain a line 'RT: retention time'</dd>

    <dt>Add ANOVA p-value (if present)</dt>
    <dd>If selected, each MSP record will contain a line 'ANOVA_P_VALUE: p-value' if such p-value is present</dd>

    <dt>Integer m/z</dt>
    <dd>If selected, fractional m/z values will be rounded to the closest integer and a new intensity is calculated
        based on the merging mode:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Maximum:</em> new intensity is the maximum of merged intensities</li>
            <li><em>Sum:</em> new intensity is the sum of merged intensities</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

</dl>
