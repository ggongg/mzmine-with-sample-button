<h1>mzTab-m import</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This module imports the contents of a mzTab-m file into a peak list. If links to raw data files are available
in the mzTab-m file, these can automatically be imported together with the peak list. The raw data import looks for files
in the location provided in the mzTab-m file, if not present it looks in the same folder as that of mzTab-m file,
if still not present it looks if files are present in compressed form (.gz or .zip). If files are nowhere to be found
finally empty rawFiles are created.
</p>
