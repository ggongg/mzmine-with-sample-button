<h1>Isotope pattern comparison</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
Several modules in MZmine offer the option the compare the isotope patterns of peaks and assign a score (percentage) of similarity to them. 
Until MZmine version 2.2, the CDK (Chemistry Development Kit) library was used to perform this operation.
An improved algorithm, introduced in MZmine.3, is described below.
</p>

<h3>Comparison algorithm</h3>

<p>
The similarity of two isotope patterns is determined as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
   Both isotope patterns are normalized (such that highest isotope in each pattern has the intensity of 1.0) and merged into a single spectrum, where all isotopes from the first pattern have a positive intensity, while for the isotopes of the second pattern the intensity is negated.
</li>
<li>
   A sliding window of user-defined width ("Isotope m/z tolerance" parameter) is moved over the whole m/z range, from the lowest m/z to the highest. Each pair of isotope peaks fitting within the window is added together, forming a single peak with the m/z value of the higher m/z of the pair.
</li>
<li>
   The final similarity score is calculated from the remaining peaks as<br>

   where <i>I<sub>i</sub></i> is the intensity of remaining peak i.
</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
A trivial observation is that for two identical isotope patterns the similarity score will be 100%, 
while for two completely different patterns 0% score is returned. 
Only a single parameter is required for the evaluation of the algorithm, 
defining the width of the sliding window. 
It should be noted, though, that the optimal value of this parameter
might be different from the commonly perceived “mass accuracy” of
the instrument, because mass resolving power and preprocessing 
of the data must be considered. For example, even if the mass 
accuracy of the major isotopes may be less than 0.001 m/z, 
the mass difference between minor isotopes may be significantly higher.
