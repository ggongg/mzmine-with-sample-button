<h1>Composite weighted cosine spectral similarity (identity)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Is used to determine the similarity between two spectra (usually library and query spectra). Especially useful for very reproducible generation of spectra (GC-EI-MS). Takes into account the relative intensities of neighbouring signals in the two spectra.
